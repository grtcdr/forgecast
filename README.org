#+TITLE: Forgecast

* Introduction

Forgecast provides a set of helper functions that allow linking files
to their corresponding resource at a remote repository. Forgecast is
an amalgamation of the words "forge" and "cast"; it should be thought
of as a tool to "cast documents to their forges".

Here's a quick demo:

/Who is it for?/

If you have built a blog on top of the Org Mode ecosystem of
libraries, for example [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Project-alist.html][org-publish-project-alist]], then this package
may help you address transparency and improve accessibility by
/automatically/ linking your blog posts to their original source for
you, as well as other kinds of information such as revision history.

/What forges does it support?/

- GitHub
- GitLab and derivative deployments
- SourceHut and derivative deployments
- Gitea and derivative deployments
- cgit deployments

* Usage

Forgecast is an extension of [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][Org Mode's publishing feature]] and should
therefore be called from a publishing script, i.e. your
website/project specification.

See the provided [[https://github.com/grtcdr/forgecast/tree/example][example]] for a minimal working example and then visit
[[https://grtcdr.tn/forgecast][the published website]] for a live demonstration.

* Installation

Find and navigate to a project you wish to extend with Forgecast's
capabilities.

Now, clone the project:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/grtcdr/forgecast.git
#+end_src

Likewise, you may choose to add it as a submodule:

#+begin_src sh
git submodule add https://github.com/grtcdr/forgecast.git
#+end_src
