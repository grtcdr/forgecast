#+TITLE: Liaison

Liaison generalizes and automates the process of linking an HTML
document to its corresponding source document originally written in
the Org markup language.

This page serves the purpose of demonstrating the principal
functionality of this package, which is what generated the URLs you
find beneath every blog post.

This package, like so many others, provides documentation in a number
of formats:
- [[file:manual.org][HTML]] -- to get you started.
- [[file:manual.pdf][PDF]] -- for when you're on the go.
- Info -- available in the source tree.
