#+TITLE: Liaison

Liaison generalizes and automates the process of linking an /HTML/
document to its corresponding source document originally written in
the /Org/ markup language --- its purpose is to generate URLs that
point to a specific page in a Git web interface, e.g. the tree, blob,
blame, edit pages and more.

You should see the provided [[file:examples/cheese.org][example]] that showcases a very simple
implementation to demonstrate the usefulness of this package. You will
also find documentation -- to guide you as you navigate this rather
abstract library -- that's available in a number of formats:
- [[file:manual.org][HTML]]
- [[file:manual.pdf][PDF]]
- Info -- which you can find in the source tree (under the =doc= directory)
