#+TITLE: Liaison

Liaison generalizes and automates the process of mapping an /HTML/
document to its corresponding source document originally written in
the /Org/ markup language --- its purpose is to generate URLs that
point to a specific page in a Git web interface, e.g. the tree, blob,
blame, edit pages and more.

Liaison [[https://grtcdr.tn/posts/2022-10-08.html][began as a small endeavor]] to provide complete transparency
about the history of documents without hindering the reading
experience, one of its main goals is to support a wide array of forges
and to integrate seamlessly with the =ox-publish.el= library.

Here's an [[file:examples/cheese.org][example]] that showcases a very simple implementation to
demonstrate the usefulness of this package.

Documentation is available in a number of formats:
- [[file:manual.org][HTML]]
- [[file:manual.pdf][PDF]]
- Info -- which you can find in the source tree (under the =doc= directory)
