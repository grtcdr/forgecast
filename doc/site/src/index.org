#+TITLE: Forgecast

Forgecast generalizes and automates the process of linking an HTML
document to its corresponding source document originally written in
the Org markup language.

This page serves no real purpose other than to demonstrate the
principal functionality of this package, which is what generated the
URLs you find beneath every blog post.

The contents of the blog posts are mumbo-jumbo, do not attempt to read
them - this is, after all, purely a demonstration.
